# reactive-banana-sdl2

Bindings between [reactive-banana](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana) package
and the [sdl2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2) package (a Haskell binding to the
[libsdl](http://libsdl.org) library which is written in C).


This library ports [reactive-banana-sdl](https://github.com/JPMoresmau/reactive-banana-sdl)
-- which depends on the older, more rudimentary, libsdl-1 specific
[SDL to Haskell bindings](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SDL) and a pre-1.0 version of the
[reactive-banana library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana)
-- to depend on the latest and greatest of both.
